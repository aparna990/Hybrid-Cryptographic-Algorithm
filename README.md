# Hybrid-Cryptographic-Algorithm

Undergraduate Project to develop a Hybrid Cryptographic Algorithm using a combination of ECC, RSA and MD5

Introduction and Idea:
The crux of the project is in strengthening the strength of passwords in a twofold manner
The project is aimed at implementing a new security algorithm, on both client and server 
end, and one that uses a hybrid cryptographic architecture. The existing system is prone 
to collision attacks and can be compromised by attackers. In order to strengthen the 
system, hybrid architecture is proposed that is more resistant to attack and hence can 
provide a secure form of information exchange between connected computers. This new 
security algorithm is designed using a combination of both symmetric and asymmetric 
cryptographic techniques. This can be achieved by the combinatorial effect of Dual RSA, 
Elliptic Curve Cryptography implemented by ECDH and Hash algorithm implemented by MD5.
